My Second Blog Post

This is a short description for my very first blog post.

import { BlogImage } from "@/components/blog-image";

Welcome to my first blog. The [frontmatter](/about) is now being displayed by our layout component.

The rest of your markdown content goes here, and it will be passed as `children` to the layout.

```cpp title="age_checker.cpp" showLineNumbers {6-7}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int age;

    std::cout << "Please enter your age: ";
    std::cin >> age;

    std::cout << "You are " << age << " years old." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

You’ve been assigned an essay and the [anxiety](https://google.com) are clear: “Perform a close reading.” For many, this phrase is a source of anxiety. Does it mean reading with your face closer to the page? Is it just a fancy term for summarizing? What are you actually supposed to be looking for?

## Using Effect Error Handling

Here is another paragraph to demonstrate the **spacing and styling** that we have applied. This text should follow the rules defined in our blog-post.css file, inheriting base styles from globals.css and applying its own specific margins.

1. This is the first item in an ordered list.

2. Each list item should have consistent spacing.

3. Let's add a third item for good measure.

### H3 Heading

Following the ordered list, this paragraph introduces the final element, an unordered list. The goal is to ensure all typographic elements are visually balanced and adhere to the new styling rules, creating a pleasant reading experience for the user.

- **list-inside**: This tells the browser to place the marker (the bullet or number) inside the list item's text box. If the text content starts on a new line (which can happen when MDX wraps list content in tags), it appears underneath the marker.

- **list-outside**: This places the marker outside the text box. The text content is indented, and all lines of text will align correctly with each other, which is the standard appearance you expect.

You’ve been assigned an essay and the instructions are clear: “Perform a close reading.” For many, this phrase is a source of anxiety. Does it mean reading with your face closer to the page? Is it just a fancy term for summarizing? What are you actually supposed to be looking for?

If you've found yourself asking these questions, you're not alone. Close reading is one of the most fundamental skills in literary analysis, yet it's often misunderstood. It’s not about finding a single “hidden meaning” but about engaging in a deep, detailed analysis of a text to understand how it creates meaning. It's a foundational skill for many forms of literary study, including rhetorical analysis, which focuses specifically on the art of persuasion.

Think of yourself as a detective. A summary tells you that a crime occurred, but a close reading dusts for fingerprints, analyzes the fiber evidence, and examines the suspect's word choice to build a compelling case. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know, from the basic definition to advanced strategies and a step-by-step example, transforming you into a confident and insightful reader.
