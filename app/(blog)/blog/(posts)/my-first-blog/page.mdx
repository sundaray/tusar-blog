<BlogPostLayout frontmatter={frontmatter}>

Welcome to my first blog. The [frontmatter](/about) is now being displayed by our layout component.

The rest of your markdown content goes here, and it will be passed as `children` to the layout.

```tsx title="app/components/my-component.tsx" showLineNumbers {4}
import React from "react";

export default function MyComponent() {
  // This is a comment
  const message = "Hello, Shiki!";
  return <div>{message}</div>;
}
```

You’ve been assigned an essay and the [anxiety](https://google.com) are clear: “Perform a close reading.” For many, this phrase is a source of anxiety. Does it mean reading with your face closer to the page? Is it just a fancy term for summarizing? What are you actually supposed to be looking for?

  caption="The latest Apple AirPods Pro with the new charging case."

## H2 Heading

Here is another paragraph to demonstrate the **spacing and styling** that we have applied. This text should follow the rules defined in our blog-post.css file, inheriting base styles from globals.css and applying its own specific margins.

1. This is the first item in an ordered list.

2. Each list item should have consistent spacing.

3. Let's add a third item for good measure.

### H3 Heading

Following the ordered list, this paragraph introduces the final element, an unordered list. The goal is to ensure all typographic elements are visually balanced and adhere to the new styling rules, creating a pleasant reading experience for the user.

- **list-inside**: This tells the browser to place the marker (the bullet or number) inside the list item's text box. If the text content starts on a new line (which can happen when MDX wraps list content in tags), it appears underneath the marker.

- **list-outside**: This places the marker outside the text box. The text content is indented, and all lines of text will align correctly with each other, which is the standard appearance you expect.
